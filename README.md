# migraine-llvm (WIP)

Based on my previous projeect [migraine](https://github.com/bishan-batel/migraine)

Whereas my previous project was intepreted, I am working in this
one to make a better parser than the last aswell as
integrating LLVM for JIT compilation

This project is still very much in it's early stages as I am trying to work with [pest.rs](https://pest.rs) as well as finalize some updates to the syntax of the language. More details for the project can be found in the old github repository.
